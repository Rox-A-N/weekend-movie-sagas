# Movie Sagas- Mixing it up with React-Redux-Sagas

Duration: 2 Weeks to Completion

## Description

What is this project?
This project is a MovieList that will allow the user to click on a specific movie poster and switch views to a Movie specific detail view.  
It will show:
    - Title
    - Image
    - Description
    - Genres that the movie falls into
    - It will include a back button to the Home/List Page



Project Solves:
    -Displaying Individual Movie Details with each movies specific genres. I worked on this in two parts: 
        Adding features to the existing Movie App with React-Redux and Redux-Sagas
        Utilizing SQL, with my database created in Postico consisting of three tables.
       
Install Dependencies
    1. npm install
    2. npm run server
    3. npm run client

## Feature List

Home/List Page- It displays all of the movies in the movie database.

Details Page

This shows all details including ALL genres for the selected movie, including title, description, and the image, too!
Details page has a Back to List button which brings the user to the Home/List Page.  This was styled using MUI and put into it's own component and imported into the Details page.


## Database Setup-X

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database
